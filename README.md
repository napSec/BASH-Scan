# BASH-Scan

Bash based portscanner 
This script will prompt the user to enter the target IP address or hostname to scan, 
and then offer them a choice of output formats (text, CSV, or XML). 
The user can then enter the desired #name for the output file, and the script will perform a port scan using nmap and save the output to a #file with the chosen name and extension. 

Finally, the script will open a new terminal session and display the contents of the output file.
Note: The command to open a new terminal and execute a command (gnome-terminal -e "command") may not #work on all systems. 

##You may need to use a different command, such as xterm -e "command", depending on your system and the #Terminal emulator you are using.
